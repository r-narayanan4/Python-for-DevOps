# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Identity Operators
- Membership Operators
- Bitwise Operators


## Python divides its operators into several groups:

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (remainder of the division)
- `**` Exponentiation (power)
- `//` Floor division (quotient of the division)

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` Assign value
- `+=` Add and assign
- `-=` Subtract and assign
- `*=` Multiply and assign
- `/=` Divide and assign
- `%=` Modulus and assign
- `**=` Exponentiation and assign
- `//=` Floor division and assign

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.

- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and` Logical AND
- `or` Logical OR
- `not` Logical NOT

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

- `is` Returns true if both variables are the same object
- `is not` Returns true if both variables are not the same object

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

- `in` Returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
- `not in` Returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on integers.

- `&` Bitwise AND
- `|` Bitwise OR
- `^` Bitwise XOR
- `~` Bitwise NOT
- `<<` Left shift
- `>>` Right shift
