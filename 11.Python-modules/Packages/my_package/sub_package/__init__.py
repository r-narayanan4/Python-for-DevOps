# This is the __init__.py file for the subpackage sub_package.

# This file can also be empty, serving the same purpose as the __init__.py file in the parent package.

# It's used to mark the subpackage directory as a Python package directory.

# Similar to the parent package, it is executed when the subpackage is imported, allowing initialization code to be included here.
